Still a work in progress, but it fulfills all the requirements for project 2.

How to use:
1) Select the color you want your object to be (currently only a pyramid)
2) Create an object by pressing create pyramid
	A pyramid will appear of the color of your choice
3) controls:
	Rotate object with W,A,S,D and Q,E
	Scale object with left and right arrow keys
	change depth of object using up and down arrows
	Move object along x and y axis by holding down mouse and dragging object
4) Work to be done:(in order of to do list)
	Add more objects to be created
	Allow user to modify object's after creation
	Allow user to turn texture's on and off
	Allow user to change light parameters
	Make move all feature not interact easier (tends to make object difficult to control afterwards
	Allow user to change texture
